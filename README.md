## User Stories
### MVP Goals:
1. Create the 8x8 game board and start button upon launch.
2. After the start button is pushed initialize all 32 pieces in their correct positions (16 pawns, 4 knights, 4 bishops, 4 rooks, 2 queens, and 2 kings).
3. Give pawns functionality: ability to move one tile forward as long as there are no pieces occupying the tile (two if they are at their starting position) and potentially capture one tile in front of them diagonally if there is an enemy piece there.
4. After the game has begun provide a reset button where a user can reset the game at any time.
### Stretch Goals:
1. Give bishops functionality: ability to move unlimited tiles diagonally in any direction until there is a piece in the way and potentially capture if it is an enemy piece.
2. Give knights functionality: ability to jump to their specific tiles (for information regarding the specific tiles please reference the guide given in the project description section) and capture any piece that is there.
3. Give rooks functionality: ability to move unlimited tiles in a straight line (not diagonally) until there is a piece in the way and potentially capture if it is an enemy piece.
